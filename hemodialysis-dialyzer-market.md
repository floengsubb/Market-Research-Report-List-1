<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hemodialysis Dialyzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Flux</li><li>High Flux</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hemodialysis dialyzer market is divided into two main types: low flux and high flux dialyzers. Low flux dialyzers are designed with smaller pores, effectively removing smaller molecules and waste products while allowing some larger substances to pass. In contrast, high flux dialyzers feature larger pores that enable the removal of a broader range of toxins, including larger molecules and middle molecules. This distinction influences treatment efficacy, patient outcomes, and can cater to varying patient needs in dialysis therapy.</p></p>
